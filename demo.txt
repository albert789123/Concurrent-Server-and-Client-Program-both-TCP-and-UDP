"demo.mp4" is the demo of SEND and RECV mode using TCP and UDP.
There are 4 clients in total, one is SEND mode using TCP, one is RECV mode using TCP, one is SEND mode using UDP, one is RECV mode using UDP.
Because the printing of statistics will be slow when the pktrate is too low, all 4 clients run with pktrate = 0 which means as fast as possible.

"demo.mp4" is the demo of RESPONSE mode using TCP and UDP.
There are 2 clients in total, one is RESPONSE mode using TCP, one is RESPONSE mode using UDP.
Because the printing of statistics will be slow when the pktrate is too low, both clients run with pktrate = 0 which means as fast as possible.
